# 🎭 Building Digital Humans with NVIDIA ACE–style Pipeline (Demo + Code)

I just built a **digital human** prototype that combines:
- 🎙️ Speech → (mock now, swap to **NVIDIA Riva**)
- 🧠 Intelligence → (mock now, swap to **Nemotron** via **NIM**)
- 😀 Facial animation → (mock now, swap to **Audio2Face**)
- ⚡ Runs realtime in a lightweight web UI

**Why it matters:** Digital humans can scale high-quality interactions for **retail, banking, and healthcare** while keeping experiences human-like and multilingual.

**What I did:**
- Designed a clean **orchestration backend (FastAPI)** with adapters for ASR, LLM, TTS, and A2F.
- Built a **web avatar** that lip-syncs via visemes.
- Provided drop-in connectors to NVIDIA **NIM/Riva/Audio2Face** for REAL mode.

**Repo & demo:** (add your GitHub link + 20s screen capture)

**Tech:** FastAPI, JS/Canvas, NVIDIA ACE (NIM, Riva, Audio2Face)

Happy to share the code or help others wire up the REAL mode. #AI #NVIDIA #ACE #DigitalHumans #Riva #Nemotron #Audio2Face #GenerativeAI
